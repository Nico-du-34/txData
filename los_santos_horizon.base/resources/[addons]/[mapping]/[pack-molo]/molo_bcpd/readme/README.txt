Hi and thank's for use molo modding interior ! 

Fast tutorials : 

What FiveM server version i need to run it properly?

- You have to update your server build to 4760 or above to avoid any crashes.


How does this new Cfx.re system works?

- All resources being encrypted by Cfx.re, and linked to your personal Cfx.re account.
 This process is automated and instant. Purchases are tied to your Cfx.re account, not a specific license key.
If you buy a package, it will work for all of your keys. If another Cfx.re account needs access to the package, 
you need to transfer your license on the Keymaster: https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants.

- It's possible to have somes issue if you have an mapping near mine :
- Occlusion name :
 
cs1_occl_09.ymap

- All textures can be changed by the YTD 
( molo_bcpd )

- The file  'molo_bcpd_ext2.ydr' are totaly unlocked by CFX you can change what you want on it.
            'molo_bcpd_ext.ydr'
