"AdvancedParking" (the "software") is a resource for the "FiveM" modification for the game "Grand 
Theft Auto V" and is comprised of the files this license is attached to. It is only meant to 
function inside of this environment.

The software is only sold through the online store located at https://tbx.kiminaze.de and can be 
downloaded at https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants after purchase.

The information in this license can be changed by any update of the software.

The "customer" (the person that acquired this software legally) is granted permission to use and 
modify all of its parts except the encrypted portions of the software.

The customer is not allowed to publish and/or distribute the software, copies of the software, 
parts of the software and/or modifications of the software.

By using this software the customer is accepting this license and by updating the software any 
potential changes are accepted as well.


## Updates

Updates to the software are provided by the copyright holder given there are new features to be 
implemented into the software or problems with the software (errors, bugs, glitches) that need to 
be resolved.

Updates will only be provided as deemed necessary by the copyright holder.

Updates can be downloaded at https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants.

Major updates can potentially contain breaking changes towards backwards compatibility that will be 
communicated in the patch notes. It is the customers responsibility to carefully read the patch 
notes.

Patch notes for outdated software can be found in the FiveM server console log when starting the 
software and at a set interval. Notifications for new updates can be seen in the official Discord 
server and as new posts in the official FiveM forum.

All patch notes are located at https://github.com/Kiminaze/version_history.


## Support

Support for the software is provided at the [official Discord server](https://discord.kiminaze.de) 
in English and German.

Support is provided to the customer and a second person that can be chosen at the customers 
discretion.

Support is provided for, but not limited to:
- Installation of the software
- Configuration of the software
- Problems revolving directly around the software (errors, bugs, glitches)

Support can be provided in the following forms:
- text chat
- voice call
- voice call with screenshare

Support for the software will be terminated under the following conditions:
- The online store closes.
- The software is no longer being sold.

The customer can be excluded from support when infringing upon this license or breaking any rule in 
the Discord server or in Discord in general. Not providing necessary information after repeated 
requests can also lead to exclusion. Should this happen and a second person had been chosen for 
support, they will also be excluded from support.

If the customer has been excluded from support, support can be reinstated by resolving any 
previously arisen issues.

All liability claims no longer apply if changes have been made to the software by the customer.
